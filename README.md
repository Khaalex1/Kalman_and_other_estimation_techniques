# Kalman_Filter_Application_Ex

Status : code works but is undocumented

This repository contains codes personally developped during the Kalman Filter course I had in 2nd year in engineering school.
The files, entitled TP_1..., TP_2... etc., correspond to the codes answering the questions of the exercices within "ensi_isterobV2.pdf".
Each code refer to a particular section and exercice of the pdf.
To summarize the topics adressed by each file :
- TP1 : Space representation, rotation matrices, Euler angles
- TP2 : Least Square Estimator
- TP3 : Lidar localization by a Monte-Carlo type method
- TP4 : Introduction to probabilities, Covariance matrices
- TP5 : Linear estimation : Kalman's correction
- TP6 : Complete Kalman filter : correction and prediction 
- TP7 : Kalman's filter application to the localization of a robot
- BE : Assessment made with my colleague and friend H. BONTEMPS on a SLAM problematic (last pages of the pdf)
